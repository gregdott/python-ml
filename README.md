Repo for machine learning stuff written in Python

This was only just recently created, so don't expect much just yet...

Code that ends up here will be related to my learning about various things in Machine Learning, starting with ultra-basic stuff like linear regression.

I will do my best to ensure that there are raw Python files for each of the Jupyter Notebook files provided.
